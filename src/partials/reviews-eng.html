        Program. Our friends live in different parts of their beloved country,
        but all of them are united by a craving for knowledge and knowledge of

          both. The cards are of very good quality. Children are delighted! They
          love to play with them. I recommend to everyone!

          Thank you for the wonderful set of postcards! We all enjoyed it very
          much. Now we play - turn on the video and look for the corresponding
          card with a bird on the video. Children are 4 years old, they are very
          interesting. Names, appearance are easy to remember and you can hear
          how each bird sings. A big plus is that the cards are in Ukrainian and
          English. For me, the name of some birds in Ukrainian is a curiosity. I
          never knew that the WITNESS is OMELYUKH. Parents learn with their
          children!
